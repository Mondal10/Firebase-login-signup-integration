# Firebase Authentication
**Description:** Firebase Auth is a service that can authenticate users using only client-side code. It supports social login providers Facebook, GitHub, Twitter and Google (and Google Play Games). Additionally, it includes a user management system whereby developers can enable user authentication with email and password login stored with Firebase.

So I tried to implement it and here is my work [:point_right: click :point_left:](https://mondal10.github.io/Firebase-login-signup-integration/) 

## _What it can do :no_mouth:?_
- Create account using normal **email-id with verification** of email to check authenticity of user.
- Create account using existing **Google** account.
- Create account using existing **Facebook** account. (Very tedious :expressionless:)
- Once user is Logged in they can see their account information by clicking on account tab.
- I should have tried integration with Twitter, GitHub, Google Play Games and Phone Number but I was bored :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

## _Tecnologies Used :computer::_
- HTML
- [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com/) because I was bored to align things using normal CSS :sleepy:
- JavaScript :heart:
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
